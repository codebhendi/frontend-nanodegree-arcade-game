===============================
### How to run the game
To run the game simply open the file index.html in your browser.
After all the in game elements load the enemies should start spawning and
you can start moving the main character.

### Controls
You can control the player sprite using your arrow keys for the systems which
have arrow keys. I have not tested it on mobile so no idea how to use it.
Up key will move the player up, left will move it to left and so on.
Each key press will move the character a certain distance.
Long key press will do nothing. Player can not move out of the game area.

### How to win or not lose
Player loses if it touches the enemy i.e. the moving bugs. If it reaches the
water then he has won the game.
